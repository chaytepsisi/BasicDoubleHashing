# BasicDoubleHashing
A basic console application to count the approximate maximum number of zeros in a double hashing game.

The application counts the number of maximal leading zeros in the outputs of double SHA-256 hashing for 10 times to give an idea about the hardness of the problem for the host computer. 

Note that the code is not considering performance optimizations of multitasking.
